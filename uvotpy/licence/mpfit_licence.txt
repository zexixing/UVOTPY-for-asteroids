MPFIT author information, license. 

The mpfit.py module is used by uvotpy to perform fitting using 
Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization. 

Though no licence is available for the mpfit.py author information 
is available. The best available record of how the software was 
authored is below.

The Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization is based 
on MINPACK-1.

                                                                   
The original version of this software, called LMFIT, was written 
in FORTRAN as part of the MINPACK-1 package by  Jorge Moré, 
Burt Garbow, and Ken Hillstrom. 
The MINPACK software is distributed with the license reproduced here
and named "MINPACK_license.txt". 

Craig Markwardt converted the FORTRAN code to IDL.  The information for the
IDL version is:
